            <h1>About Ladies & Lenses</h1>
            <p>Established in 2020 by lead photographer, Michelle Saldana, Ladies & Lenses strives to provide a professional and inclusive photography experience. 
                Based in sunny Orange County California, L&L has access to a seemingly unlimited source of vibrant scenes, backdrops, and inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>Michelle Saldana has been modeling for the past 10 years and has a wide range of photographs of herself which can be found 
                <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                Her love of modeling led her to find a passion for being behind the lense as well. For the past 6 years she has been styling and organizing shoots.
                <q>Photography has always been a way for me to create. I love all the ways we can each perceive a single photograph, it's beautiful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In her spare time, Michelle runs a non-profit known as Helping Homeless Companions (HHC).
                At HHC, she and her crew dedicate their time and resources to providing assistance and services to individuals without shelter and their beloved pets.
                They hope to keep as many pets with their owners as possible because they believe that the bond between the two can be sacred and trasnformative.
            </p>
